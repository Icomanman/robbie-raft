The `Tool` is a fundamental Roblox `Instance` class designed specifically for **equippable items** that players can hold and interact with. Think of weapons, healing potions, unique gadgets, or even a simple flashlight.

### Key Characteristics of a `Tool`:

1.  **Equippable:** Its primary purpose is to be equipped by a `Humanoid` (which players have). When equipped, it appears in the player's hand.
2.  **Parenting:**
    * When a player picks up a `Tool`, it's usually parented to their `Backpack`.
    * When equipped, it temporarily parents to the player's `Character` model (specifically, usually the `Right Arm` or `Left Arm`), and then back to the `Backpack` when unequipped.
3.  **`Instance` Subclass:** `Tool` inherits from `Instance`, meaning it has all the common `Instance` properties (like `Name`, `Parent`, `Enabled`, `Archivable`, etc.) and methods (`Destroy()`, `FindFirstChild()`, `IsA()`).

### Common Properties of the `Tool` Class:

* **`.Handle` (Part):** This is a crucial property. If your `Tool` has a `Part` named exactly "Handle" directly inside it, Roblox will automatically use this part as the point where the player "grips" the tool. If no "Handle" part exists, Roblox will try to use the first `BasePart` found inside the tool as the handle, or may not work correctly.
* **`.CanBeDropped` (boolean):** If `true` (default), players can drop the tool by pressing the "Drop" key.
* **`.RequiresHandle` (boolean):** If `true` (default), the tool *must* have a `Handle` part to be equipped properly. If `false`, the tool can be equipped even without a `Handle`.
* **`.Enabled` (boolean):** If `true` (default), the tool can be activated. Set to `false` to temporarily disable its functionality (e.g., during a cooldown).
* **`.Grip` (CFrame):** The offset from the `Handle`'s origin to where the player's hand will attach. This is often adjusted in Studio to fine-tune how the tool is held.

### Common Events of the `Tool` Class:

These events allow you to trigger code when a player interacts with the tool:

* **`.Equipped` (Event):** Fires when the player equips the tool.
    * **Use:** Play equip animations, enable tool functionality.
    ```lua
    tool.Equipped:Connect(function()
        print("Tool was equipped!")
    end)
    ```
* **`.Unequipped` (Event):** Fires when the player unequips the tool.
    * **Use:** Stop equip animations, disable tool functionality, clean up effects.
    ```lua
    tool.Unequipped:Connect(function()
        print("Tool was unequipped!")
    end)
    ```
* **`.Activated` (Event):** Fires when the player clicks/taps while the tool is equipped.
    * **Use:** Trigger primary actions like firing a gun, using an ability, consuming a potion.
    ```lua
    tool.Activated:Connect(function()
        print("Tool was activated!")
    end)
    ```
* **`.Deactivated` (Event):** Fires when the player releases a click/tap (after `Activated`).
    * **Use:** Stop continuous actions (e.g., stop a laser beam).
    ```lua
    tool.Deactivated:Connect(function()
        print("Tool was deactivated!")
    end)
    ```

### Common Children of a `Tool`:

Tools often contain other instances to define their appearance and behavior:

* **`Part` / `MeshPart` / `UnionOperation`:** For the visual components of the tool.
* **`Script` / `LocalScript`:**
    * **`LocalScript`:** For client-side behavior (UI updates, visual effects, player input). These scripts will run when the tool is equipped/activated by the player who owns it.
    * **`Script`:** For server-side behavior (damage calculations, secure cooldowns, critical game logic). These scripts will run on the server when the tool is equipped.
* **`Sound`:** For audio effects (e.g., reload sound, hit sound).
* **`Animation`:** For custom animations the tool should play when equipped or activated.

### Example Tool Structure in Explorer:

```
Tool (ClassName: Tool, e.g., "MySword")
├── Handle (Part, **MUST be named "Handle" for automatic gripping**)
├── Blade (Part)
├── LocalScript (Handles client-side effects, e.g., animations, UI)
├── Script (Handles server-side logic, e.g., damage calculation)
├── SwingSound (Sound)
└── BlockAnimation (Animation)
```

The `Tool` class provides a robust framework for creating interactive items in your game, blending its built-in properties and events with your custom Lua logic using `Script`s and `LocalScript`s inside it, or by associating it with your custom Lua objects using a manager pattern as discussed previously.
